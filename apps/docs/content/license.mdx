# License

Kasho is licensed under the **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)**.

## What This Means

### You Can

- Use Kasho for internal purposes within your organization
- Modify the source code for your own use
- Create derivative works
- Use Kasho for development, testing, and staging environments
- Self-host Kasho for your own databases

### You Cannot

- Offer Kasho to third parties as a hosted service that competes with Kasho's commercial offerings
- Embed Kasho in a commercial product that competes with Kasho

### After 4 Years

Each version of Kasho automatically converts to the **MIT License** four years after its release date. This means older versions become fully open source over time.

## Additional Use Grant

The BSL 1.1 includes an Additional Use Grant that permits production use, provided your use does not include offering Kasho to third parties on a hosted or embedded basis to compete with Kasho's paid versions.

Using Kasho for internal purposes within your organization (including all affiliates under common control) is explicitly permitted and is not considered competitive use.
