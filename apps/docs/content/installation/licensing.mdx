# Licensing

Kasho requires a valid license file to operate. The license validates your subscription and enables the software to run on your infrastructure.

  **Seeking Design Partners**
  
  Kasho is actively seeking design partners to help shape our future plans. If you're interested in exploring a design partnership and obtaining a license, please reach out to [hello@kasho.io](mailto:hello@kasho.io).
</Callout>

## License Requirements

All Kasho services require a valid license file to start and operate. The license:

- Is provided as a JWT (JSON Web Token) file
- Contains your customer information and subscription details
- Must be placed at `/app/config/license.jwt` in your container
- Is validated on service startup

## License File Location

The license file must be mounted at `/app/config/license.jwt` in each Kasho container. This is the same directory where your `transforms.yml` configuration file is located.

### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  pg-change-stream:
    image: kasho/pg-change-stream:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    # ... other configuration

  pg-translicator:
    image: kasho/pg-translicator:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    # ... other configuration
```

### Kubernetes Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kasho-config
data:
  license.jwt: |
    eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
  transforms.yml: |
    # Your transforms configuration
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pg-change-stream
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pg-change-stream
        image: kasho/pg-change-stream:latest
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /app/config
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: config
        configMap:
          name: kasho-config
```

## License Validation

When a Kasho service starts, it will:

1. Check for the presence of `/app/config/license.jwt`
2. Validate the license signature and format
3. Verify the license has not expired
4. Extract customer information and features

If the license is invalid or expired, the service will fail to start with a clear error message indicating the issue.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service fails to start with "license file not found"**
- Ensure the license file is mounted at `/app/config/license.jwt`
- Check that the volume mount includes read permissions
- Verify the file exists in your local config directory

**Service fails with "license expired"**
- Contact your Kasho representative to renew your license
- For design partners, reach out to hello@kasho.io

**Service fails with "invalid license format"**
- Ensure the license file has not been modified or corrupted
- The file should be a valid JWT token provided by Kasho
- Contact support if you need a replacement license

## Next Steps

Once you have a valid license file in place, continue with:
- [Configuration](/installation/configuration) - Set up your transforms and service configuration
- [Bootstrap Process](/installation/bootstrap) - Initialize your target database with existing data
