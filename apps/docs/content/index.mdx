# Welcome to Kasho

Kasho solves the age-old problem of "production-like data" for staging, testing, and development environments. It does this by tapping into the replication layer of the database and putting a transformer in the middle.

## What is Kasho?

Kasho consists of two main components working together:

- **`pg-change-stream`** - Captures changes from your PostgreSQL database
- **`pg-translicator`** - Applies changes to target databases with optional transformations

Under the hood, **Redis** is used for reliable, ordered message buffering.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Live, Hot, Compliant Replicas
Stream database changes with minimal latency using PostgreSQL's logical replication, including both DDL and DML operations. Your replicas stay in sync automatically.

### 🔒 Data Transformation  
Transform sensitive data with configurable rules before writing to the replica. Perfect for creating GDPR-compliant development environments from production data.

### 📦 Simple Deployment
Deploy with Docker using a single image containing all components. Available from Docker Hub at `kashoio/kasho`. Works with Kubernetes, ECS, or any container orchestration platform.

### ⚡ Bootstrap Support
Get up and running with existing data and zero downtime using the included bootstrap process. Seamlessly migrate petabytes of data without missing a single change.
